# BuenoSpace

BuenoSpace is an all-in-one event space rental application. The purpose for proposing this project is that we believe there will be an increase in demand for individuals and companies to organise events following the improved COVID-19 situation in the country. We can boost the gig economy by developing the BuenoSpace web application, which allows space owners from all over Malaysia to list their event space in order to earn extra money. This web application is classified as transactional category.
